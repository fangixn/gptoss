## 3. Use Case Scenarios

| Use Case                      | GPT-OSS-20B           | GPT-OSS-120B   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Chatbots / Agents             | ✅ Good                 | ✅ Great         |
| Code generation (basic)       | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ More accurate |
| Research-grade NLP            | ❌ Limited              | ✅ Recommended   |
| Summarization                 | ✅ Decent               | ✅ Excellent     |
| Long-form writing             | ❌ Sometimes repetitive | ✅ Human-like    |
| Local deployment (budget)     | ✅ Easy                 | ❌ Hard          |
| Enterprise-scale applications | ✅ Possibly             | ✅ Strong        |

> In short:
- Use **20B** for **real-time, lightweight, fast deployments**
- Use **120B** for **maximum intelligence and output quality**

## 4. Cost to Run & Deploy

Let’s break down the **estimated monthly cost** (assuming 8 hours/day usage):

| Setup                           | GPT-OSS-20B      | GPT-OSS-120B   |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Single A100 cloud instance      | ~$2,000          | ❌ Not enough   |
| 4×A100 cluster (Lambda, etc)    | ❌ Too much       | ~$8,000+       |
| Local dual 3090 setup           | ~$4,000 one-time | ❌ Insufficient |
| API-style hosting (third-party) | ✅ Available      | ❌ Rare         |

> GPT-OSS-120B is **significantly more expensive** to serve in production. Many startups opt for **20B or quantized variants** (e.g. GPT-OSS-20B.Q4).

## 7. Model Availability & Quantization

| Model Variant         | GPT-OSS-20B | GPT-OSS-120B |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 4-bit (Q4)            | ✅ Yes       | ❌ Not stable |
| 8-bit (Q8)            | ✅ Yes       | ✅ In testing |
| Full precision (FP16) | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes        |

You can easily run GPT-OSS-20B on consumer hardware using `llama.cpp`, `text-generation-webui`, or `Ollama`. GPT-OSS-120B is **mostly limited to server environments**.
